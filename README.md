This repo has My latest Extensions!
<h1> How this extension works like? <h1>
So how the extension works is like that
instead of searching for a clip or an mp3 file or a gif...etc ,  that is somewhere around the project , all you have to do is type the exact name of that clip and press enter and it will be added to the time line exactly at the play head cursor !

There 3 moods :
1. You type the name and the program will try to find the an empty video and audio track and insert it ! (clip.mp4)
2. You type the name and follow it with ("/") and the number of video track that you want to insert it to.(clip.mp4/3)
3. You type the name and follow it with ("/") and the number of video track that you want to insert it to and add another ("/") if you want to specify the number of the audio track  .(clip.mp4/2/2)
